# Dolby Interactivity APIs iOS SDK Getting Started app

This is the sample app from the iOS app used in the
[Getting Started](https://dolby.io/developers/interactivity-apis/client-sdk/getting-started/create-a-basic-audio-conference-application) article. 

You can find additional reference documentation here:

## Building

Before building in Xcode, you will need to use `Carthage` to install the iOS SDK.

#### Carthage
[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Run `carthage update` to install dependencies.

If you are using Xcode 12, please see the workaround from [carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Xcode12Workaround.md)
